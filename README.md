# Attention-Basics
In this notebook, we look at how attention is implemented. We will focus on implementing attention in isolation from a larger model. That's because when implementing attention in a real-world model, a lot of the focus goes into piping the data and juggling the various vectors rather than the concepts of attention themselves.
